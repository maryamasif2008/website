            <h2>Founder Of Pakistan</h2>
            <P>
                <b>Quaid-e-Azam </b> on the 11th of September, 1948. He served his life for Pakistan. He was a man of rules and always focused on the rights of his people. He always emphasized education, stating that the future
             of our country depends upon the education we will manage to provide in the future. Some see Jinnah as a hero who fought for the rights of India's Muslim minority and successfully campaigned for the creation of a separate Muslim state. They view him as a visionary leader who helped to create a nation and a homeland for millions of Muslims.
             He was a pawn in the hands of the British. Mohammad Ali Jinnah December 25, 1876 – September 11, 1948) was a 20th century lawyer, politician, statesman and the founder of Pakistan. He is popularly and officially known in Pakistan as Quaid-e-Azam (“Great Leader”)
             and Baba-e-Qaum (“Father of the Nation”). </P>
